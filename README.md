# Mining Software Repositories Lab

This repository contains the work done during the "Mining Software Repositories" lab at the University of Passau. The lab was conducted by a group of three individuals and focused on exploring techniques and tools used for mining software repositories. Each week, the group completed a specific task, and the corresponding code and documentation can be found in the respective folders.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

1. **Week1**: This folder contains the code and documentation for the first week's task.
2. **Week2**: This folder contains the code and documentation for the second week's task.
3. **Week3**: This folder contains the code and documentation for the third week's task.

## Weekly Tasks

### Week 1
In week 1 task The research questions addressed were related to code complexity .
* (RQ1) investigates the correlation between self-admitted technical debt (SATD) in code comments and high code complexity
* (RQ2) explores the correlation between SATD in commit messages and high code complexity.
  
The tasks included repository setup, script development, data extraction, statistical analysis, and presentation preparation, all aimed at investigating the correlation between self-admitted technical debt (SATD), code complexity, and SATD patterns in code comments and commit messages.

### Week 2
In week 2 task The research questions addressed were related to pull requests in software projects.  
* (RQ1) aimed to identify the reasons for changes in pull requests by analyzing various types of comments and reviews.
* (RQ2) aimed to build a predictive machine learning model to determine whether a pull request would be merged.
  
The tasks included selecting projects, retrieving pull request data from GitHub using the API, conducting qualitative analysis, creating datasets, building a predictive model, evaluating its performance, and preparing a presentation with the results.


### Week 3
During week3, the group focused on two research questions related to code readability. 
* (RQ1) investigated whether developers deliberately increase code readability by analyzing changes in readability for files and examining the commit messages. 
* (RQ2) aimed to build a predictive model using features from the commit messages to determine if the readability of a file would improve.
  
The tasks included extracting commit information and readability data, analyzing trends using word clouds and keywords, building a Random Forest model for predicting readability improvement, and concluding with final changes, presentation preparation, and result presentation.
